# Base64

[Base64][Base64] encoding is widely used amongst different endpoints in Geometry Dash.

It is used to encode fields like level data, level descriptions, comments, etc.

GD uses *URL-safe* Base64 encoding, which uses `[A-Z]` and `[a-z]` letters
along with `_` and `-` as special characters.
